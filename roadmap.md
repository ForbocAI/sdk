# ForbocAI SDK

## The Infrastructure Layer for Autonomous AI Characters

**ᚠ ᛫ ᛟ ᛫ ᚱ ᛫ ᛒ ᛫ ᛟ ᛫ ᚲ**

---

## Executive Summary

The **ForbocAI SDK** is the foundational toolkit enabling game developers and application builders to create truly autonomous AI-powered characters. Unlike traditional NPC systems that rely on scripted behaviors, our SDK provides persistent memory, validated actions, and portable AI identities—all powered by local-first inference.

**Architecture**: A lightweight, single-package (`forbocai`) library containing the Core Logic, Inference Adapters, and Agent behaviors. Designed for easy installation and strict version compatibility.

## Market Opportunity

| Segment | TAM |
|---------|-----|
| Gaming AI/NPC Market | $3.2B by 2028 |
| Generative AI in Games | $7.1B by 2030 |
| Digital Asset Ownership | $12B by 2027 |

**Our Position**: First-mover in the intersection of generative AI agents and digital asset portability for gaming.

## Core Technology

### Cortex — Local-First Inference
Run quantized language models directly in-browser or on-device. Zero API costs. Zero latency. Full privacy.

### Agent — Autonomous Entities
Create NPCs with true personalities, emotional states, and dynamic relationships that evolve based on player interactions.

### Memory — Persistent Recall
RAG pipeline enables characters to remember past events, learn from experiences, and build long-term relationships with players.

### Bridge — Neuro-Symbolic Validation
Ensure AI-generated actions are always valid within game rules. No hallucinations breaking game state.

### Soul — Portable Identities
Export an agent's complete being—memories, personality, learned behaviors—to IPFS. Enable cross-game character portability and true digital ownership.

### Ghost — Automated QA at Scale
Deploy headless AI agents to test content, balance mechanics, and discover edge cases before players do.
